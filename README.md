# Teamwork Project Tasks Demo

I have recently decided to learn a bit of React. I have also recently started using Teamwork Project (it is awesome). So I thought I would explore the Teamwork Project API and do so with a bit of React.

I'm not 100% sure what I will end up making, but it's a good excuse to spend some time with React and the Teamwork Project API.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Compile the JSX and ES6 `gulp browserify`
4. Setup the env.js file:
    1. Copy `env.example.js` to `env.js` (in the root directory)
    2. Fill in the blanks (company, key, and projectId)
